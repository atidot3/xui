  <!--#comment
      All comments starting with #command will be preprocessed and never sent to the xml parser

      Valid instructions:

      #include ==> Include another file to this exact point
                   (partial xml should be encased in <include></include> tags)

      #set     ==> Set a global variable (can be expanded during preprocessing with $$ variables)
                   (note the double $$ which denotes preprocessor variables)

      #comment ==> A general comment such as this

      The preprocessor will compile the full xml document to ${prefix}/log/freeswitch.xml.fsxml

      The same can be achieved with the <X-PRE-PROCESS> tag where the attrs 'cmd' and 'data' are
      parsed in the same way.
